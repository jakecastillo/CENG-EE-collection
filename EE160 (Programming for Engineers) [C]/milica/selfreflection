Everyone did great on the first homework assignment. Being in constant contact with the
team did us justice in problem solving and troubleshooting went quickly. We got a lot of
work done during the week, but finished labs early so we were able to work on the homework
during the remaining lab period. What I learned from this homework is how to read in files
and how to output files. I contributed in terms of coding, debugging and logical reasoning.
One question that I have is, is it possible to create multiple output files with different
names every time so that it doesnâ€™t overwrite the older file?

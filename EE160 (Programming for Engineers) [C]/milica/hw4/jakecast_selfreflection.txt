Homework 4 self reflection.

This was by far the only homework we as a group have had a lot of problems
with. The assignment was extremely difficult and it fell between a time were
our group had a lot of other priorities to take care of as well. We worked
together as much as possible, but constant communication was difficult. The
assignment itself was difficult because in order to read in columns we
weren't allowed to pass a matrix. In the homework it said we had to pass
an array in order to do that. Overall I feel like we could have done better
given a bit longer of time restraints.

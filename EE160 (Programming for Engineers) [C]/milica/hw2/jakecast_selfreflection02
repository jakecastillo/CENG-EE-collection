ne thing I learned from HW2 is how useful writing your own functions can be.
Once you write all the functions, making the drivers was relatively easy. I
made the leap and julian functions, as well as driver 1 and driver 2. Mimi
commented our algorithm, debugged the code, and also made epoch and driver 3.
Fernanda did all of our hand calculations and made the algorithm. We did most
of our work face to face during the lab section last week, so we all
contributed equally. One question I have is why did we have so many issues
compiling the lab when everything was in tact? Weird erroes occured.
What is so different between // and /* & */? Our team
worked well as usual, because we worked face to face and have great
communication.

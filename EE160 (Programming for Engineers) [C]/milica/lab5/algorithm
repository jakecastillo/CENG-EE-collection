Algorithm for temperature table
Prompt user for starting and stop temperature in fahrenheit
If number is negative, turn it into a positive value
Starting temperature will step up five degrees each calculation
If the first number is less than the second number, convert start fahrenheit to celsius
Celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
Give value back
Step up five and repeat calculations until you reach stop fahrenheit
If second number is less than the first number, swap the numbers around convert start
fahrenheit to celsius
Give value back
Step up five and repeat calculations until you reach stop fahrenheit
